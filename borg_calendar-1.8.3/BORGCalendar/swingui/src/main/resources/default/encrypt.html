<H2><FONT FACE="Arial">Encryption</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Borg supports the optional encryption of Memos
and Appointments. When chosen, AES symmetric encryption is used to
encrypt and decrypt text before storing in the database. This
encryption is meant to be secure enough to protect any sensitive
information.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Memos and Appointments can be encrypted by
checking the Encrypt on Save check box before saving and then
supplying the encryption password when prompted. Encrypted items can
only be viewed by pressing the decrypt button and supplying the
password. The password is the same for all items (see below). </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">There is an option on the Encryption options
tab to define how long Borg will remember an entered password. The
default is 5 minutes. This means that once a valid password is
entered, the password will not have to be re-entered for further
encryption/decryption operations for 5 minutes. This time length can
be set to any value between 0 seconds and 1 year. A value of 0 would
cause Borg to prompt for the password for every encryption/decryption
operation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Borg uses a single key for all encryption. It
is kept in a Java JCEKS Key Store file and is protected by a
user-chosen password. Encryption cannot be used unless this file is
set in the Borg Encryption Options. To create an initial Key Store,
go to the Encryption Options tab and browse to create a new file.
Borg will prompt for a password and then create the Key Store with a
new random key.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Key Store file contains the encryption key
and is protected by the password that is entered when the file is
created. Whenever Borg needs to encrypt or decrypt data, it will
prompt for this password. Do not forget this password. If lost, there
is no way to recover it and any encrypted data can no longer be
decrypted. The key store password is never stored to disk in any
form. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Likewise, do not lose the Key Store file and
keep safe backup copies. If you keep the Borg database on removable
media, such as a thumb drive, and mount it on different machines, you
will not be able to decrypt secure data unless the key store file is
also available to each machine and set in the options. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For maximum security, the Key Store file should
be kept separate from the database. A malicious person that gets a
copy of your Borg database and/or your saved XML exports will not be
able to decrypt your protected data without the Key Store file. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Even with the Key Store file, a malicious
person will still not be able to decrypt Borg data without knowing
the password that was used to protect the Key Store.</FONT></P>
