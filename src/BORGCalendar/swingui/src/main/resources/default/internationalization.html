<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">BORG supports
Locales (regional settings) as of release 1.3. The Locale can be
switched from the <I><B>Options</B></I> screen. Once a new Locale is
chosen, a restart is required before the new Locale is used. The date
formats, month names, and weekday names are supported for all Locales
listed. However, the majority of text strings in BORG come from
properties files. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Except for this
Help and some README files, BORG supports many languages.
Translations to other languages would only require a translated
version of the borg_resource.properties file that comes in the BORG
jar file.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><I>During
development, new strings are added to the program. However, the
translations are not updated by the main developer. Therefore, some
new text may appear in English for the various locales until new
translations are provided to the developer.</I></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Here are
instructions on how to provide a new translation:</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">============================================</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">To change the text strings in BORG,
you have to understand a little about the borg.jar file. A jar (Java
archive) file is just a regular ZIP archive with some extra java
related items in it. The borg.jar file can be unzipped using any tool
that works on ZIP files, or using the jar tool that comes with the
Java SDK.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If you unzip the borg.jar file, you
will find that it contains a number of folders â€“ i.e. net,
META-INF, and resource. All of the files containing the BORG text
strings are in the resource folder. By editing files in the resource
folder and then re-zipping the borg.jar file, you can change the
strings shown by the GUI.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">There are 3 different categories of
text strings shown in BORG:</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">1. Strings that come from the Java Runtime</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">These are the Month and Day names.
These strings always appear in the language associated with the
locale that is set in the Appearance tab of the preferences window.
Nothing has to be done to translate these strings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Just set a new locale, restart
BORG, and you should see translated month and day names.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">2. Strings that come from Resource Bundles</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">These include all of the GUI
labels, table headers, button text, and menu text except for the
month and day names. These come from a resource bundle called
borg_resource. Resource bundles are a standard way that Java uses to
find properties for a given locale.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">When you set a locale in BORG, you
are setting 2 data items used by Java - the country and language.
Java has a 2 character code for each of these. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">These codes can be found here:
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/intl/locale.doc.html</A></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">When BORG needs to display a text
string, it first looks for the string in a file called
borg_resource_ll_cc.properties, where ll is the language and cc is
the country code. For example, the file borg_resource_fe_CA is used
first if the locale is set to French/Canada.If the given property is
not found in the file, or the file does not exist, BORG will look for
a file of the form borg_resource_ll.properties. Finally, the default
file, borg_resource.properties is used. This default file is
guaranteed to have all of the required strings. This search algorithm
is standard for Java.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">*** To create a new translation:
*** </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">1. unzip borg.jar</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">2. go to the resource folder. make
a copy of borg_resources.properties and name it according to the
locale you will use.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">3. For each string, replace the
value on the right side of the equals (=) with the translated string.
Do not touch the value to the left of the equals.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">4. re-zip borg.jar</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">*** To change an existing
translation: ***</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">1. unzip borg.jar</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">2. edit the resource file that you
want to change</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">3. re-zip the file</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">3. Strings that come from regular text or html
files inside borg.jar</H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">These include the Help text,
README, License, and CHANGES text.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">These come from regular text or
html files in the resource directory. There is currently no support
in BORG to show different versions of these files based on locale. If
you want to change them, just edit them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If you want to send me your
translated properties file so that I can include it in the next
release, email it to me at <A HREF="mailto:i_flem@users.sourceforge.net">i_flem@users.sourceforge.net</A></FONT></P>
