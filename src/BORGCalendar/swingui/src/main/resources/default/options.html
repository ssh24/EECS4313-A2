	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Look And Feel - the combo box
	will be populated only with the installed look and feels in your
	JRE. Some of the L&amp;Fs from Java are not so appealing with BORG.
	The PlasticXP look and feel is distributed with BORG to make sure
	you have at least one good looking one. If you change the look and
	feel, restart BORG to have it take effect.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">As of release 1.7.6, you can
	edit the look and feel name to indicate any look and feel that you
	like. To add a look and feel that is not in the list, you need to
	place the JAR for the look and feel in BORG's lib/ext folder, turn
	on dynamic loading so that BORG will load the JAR, type the correct
	look and feel name in the look and feel combo box, hit apply, and
	restart.</FONT></P>

	do items are marked with a strike-through when they are done and not
	removed from the calendar. Some people like to see their done items
	crossed out on the calendar. This option is for those people that
	would rather hide these items to reduce clutter.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Holidays - Most US and
	Canadian holidays can be shown (optionally). Except for Christmas,
	religious/ethnic holidays are not included - mainly because they are
	usually lunar based and harder to calculate - and because they
	aren't usually a day off from work. These can be added manually
	through the appointment editor. </FONT>

Change</FONT> will change the BORG database location and exit the

	if an error occurs and this option is set, a button will appear with
	the error screen to generate a stack trace. This can be used for
	debugging the error and can be sent to the developers. This need not
	be turned on unless debugging is being done.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Socket Port &ndash; setting a
	value here, (2929 is the default), will allow the program to detect
	when another copy is running. If you start a second copy of BORG
	when one is already running, and the socket port is set, the second
	copy will just open the running copy and exit. </FONT>

	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Backup Options: Various
	options to have BORG automatically backup your database to a ZIP
	file in a form that can be imported if you loose you data. For most
	people, this is a critical option to set. Stuff happens and disks
	die. It's important to do automatic backups, unless you are using
	some other means for backup. Backups should be done to a different
	hard disk form the one where the database is located.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Dynamic loading of plugins and
	JARs - enabling this option tells BORG to load all JARs from the
	lib/ext folder on startup. This lets the user add new look and
	feels, new database drivers, and the experimental BORG plugins. This
	feature should not be turned on unless the user has copied a JAR to
	the lib/ext folder to be loaded. Most users will not use this.</FONT></P>

	Gradient in appt boxes: used to shade the color of the appt boxes in
	the dya and week views. This should normally be turned on. This

	gradients quickly enough. Slowdowns when drawing the gradient seem
	to be a uniquely linux issue due to poor video drivers in linux for
	some video chips.</FONT></P>
