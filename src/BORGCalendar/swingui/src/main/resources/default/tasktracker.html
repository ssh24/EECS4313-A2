<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The Task Tracker</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The Task Tracker is used to keep
track of various tasks with defined start and end dates, different
statuses, descriptions, and resolutions. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">It is up to the user to decide if
something should be a task or regular appointment. To Do Appointments
can be used to hold simple tasks that require no special tracking,
such as &quot;pay mortgage&quot; or &quot;take out garbage&quot;. The
task tracker is meant for longer running, more complex tasks, such as
&quot;code new BORG feature&quot;, &quot;design new widget&quot;, or
&quot;re-floor bathroom&quot; - things that have multiple steps to
check off, that require documentation of a resolution, and/or have
&quot;sliding&quot; due dates. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">There are 3 levels of objects
managed by the task tracker – Projects, Tasks, and Subtasks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><U><B>Projects</B></U> </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">A Project is simply a way to group
related projects and tasks. A Project can set an overall due date for
all child projects and tasks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Each project can have any number of
child projects and tasks. All child tasks must have due dates on or
before the project due date. A project cannot be closed unless all of
its child tasks are closed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">You are not required to use
Projects. Tasks can still be created that are not part of any
Project.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">From the Projects tab, you can use
the buttons on the bottom of the screen to Add, Delete, Change,
Close, or Clone Projects.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">From the Project Tree, you can
right-click to add new projects or tasks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><U><B>Tasks</B></U></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Tasks are complex activities that
have start and end dates, and are created in an initial state
(default is OPEN) and progress through a user configurable tree of
states to reach an end state (default is CLOSED).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">BORG
comes with a set of default task types and states just as an example
so that the task tracker can do something useful after a fresh
install.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">If
you don't like the default task types and states, you can change
them. Please see the section below on Editing Task Types and States
for more info. The default task states are some of the ones used by
the author and provide a good example of what can be done. There is
no problem if you discard them all and replace them with your own.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.17in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">When
editing tasks, much of the functioning of the editor window is
obvious. However:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The PA (person assigned) field
doesn’t really do anything except hold data. Use it as you like.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="mozTocId783397"></A><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><U>Subtasks</U></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Subtasks are single units of work
that do not progress through a set of states. They are either
completed or not-completed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Subtasks are managed from the same
window used to edit a single tasks. Each subtask can have an optional
due date. All subtasks must have due dates on or before the parent
task’s due date. A task cannot be closed unless all of its subtasks
are closed.</FONT></P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">There are a number of places where
right-click will bring up a useful menu: the task table for a
project, the sub-task table for a task, the project tree, the
projects and tasks tabs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Also, sub-tasks do not have their
own form-based screens. Sub-task fields are edited directly in the
sub-task table. Make sure that you press Save after making changes to
the sub-task table.</FONT></P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><U>Editing Task
Types and States</U></FONT></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The user has the capability to edit
the list of task types and state transitions in the task tracker. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">There is now an editor to help you
edit the task types and states. It can be reached by choosing the
first menu item under the options-&gt;Task State Options menu. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The task state editor shows task
types, states, next states, and subtasks (from left to right). If you
select a task type on the left, the states list will reflect the
states for that task type. If you select a state, the next state list
will show the list of states that you can transition to from the
selected state. If you select a task type, the subtask list will show
the <I><B>default</B></I> subtasks for that task type. These default
subtasks are generated for all tasks of that type and are added when
the task is created. These default subtasks are optional. Tasks do
not need to have any default subtasks. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">To change anything, just select
what you want to change and right-click on it. For example, to add a
new state for a task type, select the task type and right click in
the state column. One of the options that pops up will be to add a
state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">* I realize that the documentation
on the task type editor is not really that great</FONT></P>
